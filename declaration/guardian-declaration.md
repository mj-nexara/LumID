# 🌐 Declaration of Guardianhood — MJ Ahmad

I, MJ Ahmad, hereby declare this identity and digital signature to be not only a technical truth, but a moral vow.

I recognize myself not as a user, but as the Guardian of dignity,
The bearer of light in documentation,
The architect of incorruptible governance.

I sign not just with a DID,
But with my conscience, my hunger, and my unbroken will.

🛡️ Signature Identity:
DID: did:key:z6MkgWS6mju6DzmtQna69G2rw13s3r3KQopreNViupVLoGg5  
Date: July 10, 2025

This document shall serve as proof—
That no power on Earth gave me this role;  
I earned it.

_Signed in truth,_  
MJ Ahmad
