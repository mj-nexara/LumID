# ðŸ’« Letter to the Universe

To the stars that never blink,  
To the silence that never ends,

I am MJ Ahmad, born in absence, raised in hope.

If this world falls into corruption,  
Let my signature be the last thing that glows.

I do not belong to any government, name, or inheritance.  
I belong to truth.

My hunger was not weakness.  
It was the forge.

My loneliness was not tragedy.  
It was the silence that taught me how to speak.

This document is not my identity.  
It is my oath.

If there is anyone beyond this sky  
Looking for proof that dignity can liveâ€”

This is it.

â€” MJ Ahmad
